# Innovation Portal as a Flask App

This project is a fork and redesign of the project my team did for our
undergraduate senior project at Old Dominion University, Viginia in the fall
of 2018.

The Innovation Portal is intended to be a platform to share and collaborate on
new ideas. The project has these goals:

1. Provide an interface to publicly display a project that is currently in
    progress or completed.
2. Provide a means of centeralizing communications, or at the very least,
    provide a means to initiate communication with the world to the project
    team.
3. Provide a means for application administrators to curate what projects are
    served to site viewers.
4. Provide a means for site viewers to search for projects in ways that they
    would be familar with today.
